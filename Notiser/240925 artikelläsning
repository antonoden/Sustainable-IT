consumption modeling and control strategy optimization
Abstract
"An indispensable part of a data center is the cooling system
which provides a suitable operation environment and accounts for 
around 30% of the power consumption of the data center"
catefories for cooling
1. air-cooling, 2. liquid cooling, 3. free cooling technology. 
air cooling is mostly used but the two alternatives are more effective

"A review of thermal management and innovative cooling strategies for data center"
2018 France
"Within a data center, 52% of the electricity is used by the IT equipment, 38% by the cooling system, and 10% for the remaining equipment (electrical power distribution, UPSâ€¦)"
